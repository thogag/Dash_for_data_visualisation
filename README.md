## Dataset presentation
The dataset studied comes from an evaluation carried out by a panel of ESPN experts (found on Kaggle), composed sports scientists, academicians specialized in movement, professional athletes and experienced sports journalists. Their objective was to determine, among 60 disciplines sports, which require the highest physical and cognitive abilities.

### Application's flexibility
Of course, you **can import your own dataset** at line 32 of `myapp/app.py` by applying the changes of your choice (lines 32 to 43).

## Launch of the DASH application
To launch the Dash application, follow the steps below:


1.  Open a terminal in the root folder of the project (where is
    `run.sh>).

2. Make sure the script has execution rights:

    ``` bash
    chmod +x run.sh
    ```

3. Execute the launch script:

    ``` bash
    bash . /run.sh
    ```

4. The script will automatically:

    -   create a virtual environment `venv/`
    -   install all dependencies from `requirements.txt`
    -   launch the Dash application via `app.py`

Once the application is started, open a browser and access
the address displayed in the terminal, generally:

    http://127.0.0.1:8050


## Quick presentation of the application tabs
The Dash application offers several pages to explore and analyze the ESPN sports dataset:

### Home
Central page giving access to all the project’s analyses via thematic buttons.

### YData Profiling
Displays the automatic report generated by YData: descriptive statistics, distributions, correlations and data quality.

### Linear Regression
Allows you to choose a dependent variable and several explanatory variables.  
Displays the observed points and the corresponding regression lines.

### PCA
Projects sports in a 2D space according to the main components.  
Displays the explained variance and the most contributive characteristics to the axes.

### Clusters
Selection of two variables to perform a K-Means clustering.  
Display the scatter plot as well as the Silhouette Plot to evaluate the clustering quality.

### Correlations
Heatmap of correlations between numerical variables to identify strong or redundant relationships.

### Report
Opens the written report presenting the dataset, methodology, analyses and main conclusions.

The dashboard groups all the analyses carried out as part of the project.
