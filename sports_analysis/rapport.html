      <h2>Presentation of the dataset</h2>
      <p>
        The dataset studied comes from an evaluation carried out by a panel of ESPN experts, composed 
        sports scientists, academicians specialized in movement, professional athletes 
        and experienced sports journalists. Their objective was to determine, among 60 disciplines 
        sports, which require the highest physical and cognitive abilities.

      <p>
        Each skill is assessed on a scale from 1 to 10 allowing the sports to be ranked from the most demanding to the least demanding.
        For example, boxing is identified as the most difficult sport, while fishing is among the least demanding sports.

    <!-- Dataset choice -->
    <section id="choix" class="card">
      <h2>Why did we choose this dataset?</h2>
      <p>
        Several reasons motivate the choice of this dataset for our analysis:
      </p>

      <ul class="bullets">
        <li>It offers a <strong>rich multidimensional framework</strong>, with 10 quantitative variables allowing for examining sports from multiple angles.</li>
        <li>The data is <strong>structured,reliable and easy to handle.</strong>.</li>
        <li>The theme is <strong>intuitive et relevant</strong>, facilitating analysis and interpretation.</li>
        <li>It allows <strong>advanced statistical analyses</strong> : correlation, ACP, clustering, regression.</li>
        <li>It raises interesting questions: existence of natural groups, relative importance of skills.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>


    <!-- Objectives -->
    <section id="objectifs" class="card">
      <h2>Analysis objectives</h2>
      <p>
        Through this ESPN dataset, our objective is to understand what characterizes the skills necessary for a sport. We will seek to determine whether certain skills (physical, technical, mental) are more determinant than others in the overall assessment, if difficult sports share common traits, and if one can predict the difficulty of a sport from these skills.
      </p>
      <ul class="bullets">
        <li>Identify the links between skills Correlation</li>
        <li>Reduce the dimension and visualize ACP</li>
        <li>Group sports according to specific parameters Clustering</li>
        <li>Explain and predict 'complementary' skills Regression</li>
      </ul>
    </section>


    <!-- Correlations -->
    <section id="correlations" class="card">
      <h2>Interpretation of the correlation matrix (in the "correlation" tab)</h2>
      <p>The correlation part of our dashboard presents a correlation matrix. 
        This matrix uses the Pearson correlation. A method that allows to evaluate the linear relationship between two variables. 
        In our case, we were able to visualize the dependencies between the different physical characteristics. As a reminder, it is a coefficient that is calculated between each pair of variables. 
      </p>
        <ul class="bullets">
          <li>This coefficient can be interpreted very simply : Pearson ∈ [-1, 1],</li>
          <li>Close to 0 = independent variables</li>
          <li>Pocket of 1 = dependent variable that evolves together</li>
          <li>Close to -1 = if variable 1 increases, then variable 2 decreases and vice versa</li>
        </ul>
      <p>
        Among the examples of our dataset. 
        We have a coefficient close to 0 (-0.02) between analytical ability (strategy) and flexibility, which is logical, 
        in no case does the laxity of the body allow or not allow for making a good strategic decision. 
        Conversely, we have a coefficient close to 1 (0.73) when comparing this same analytical ability with eye-hand coordination. 
        One can here theorize that good eye-hand coordination (capture of information - physical reaction) allows better decision-making. 
        in the sporting context. We could cite and explain dozens of examples, but what is important to remember here, 
        it’s that someone who would like to identify the sport that is made for them using our dashboard could identify, 
        on the basis of only one of his physical qualities, known as those that have a high probability of being associated and on the contrary, 
        the ones that seem independent or very little related.
      </p>
    </section>


    <!-- ACP -->
    <section id="acp" class="card">
      <h2>Principal Components Analysis (PCA)</h2>
      <p>
        The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) shows two axes that explain a little more of 60% of the variance of the dataset.
      </p>
      <ul class="bullets">
        <li>
          <strong>First axis (PC1 - 41.8%)</strong> : opposes sports requiring skills 
          important physical (strength, speed, endurance, etc.) to those requiring little skills 
          physical such as fishing, billiards or bowling.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Second axis (PC2 - 16.9%)</strong> : separates coordination-based sports 
          and the precision (tennis, badminton, table tennis) of those relying on the management of the 
          risk, like rodeo, ski jumping or diving.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The CPA thus highlights that the two groups of characteristics that explain the most 
        the variation in the difficulty of a sport are:
      </p>
      <ul class="bullets">
        <li><strong>The physical intensity</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Precision / coordination</strong></li>
      </ul>
    </section>


    <!-- Clustering -->
    <section id="clustering" class="card">
      <h2>Clustering (K-Means)</h2>
      <p>We applied the K-Means algorithm with k=3, based on the 10 normalized skills. Here are 2 examples of interpretation</p><br>

      <h3>Clusterization of sports based on resistance (Durability) and hand-eye coordination</h3>
      <ul class="bullets">
        <li><strong>A cohesive and coordinated group (0):</strong> Good endurance and effective hand-eye coordination, suitable for prolonged and precise tasks. </li>
        <li><strong>A coordinated but weak group (1):</strong> Excellent eye-hand coordination, but reduced durability, which may limit their performance over time. </li>
        <li><strong>A low-performing group (2):</strong> With weak hand-eye coordination and resistance, requiring reinforcement in these two areas. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The analysis shows a <strong>net segmentation of individuals</strong> based on their hand-eye coordination and durability, two essential criteria in many areas. 
        These distinctions allow to<strong>identify specific</strong> needs for each group, whether to improve endurance, precision, or both, and could serve as a basis for <strong>optimizing performance</strong> or <strong>distributing tasks</strong> based on natural abilities.
      </p><br>

      <h3>Clusterization of sports based on agility and strength</h3>
      <ul class="bullets">
        <li><strong>A performing group (0):</strong> Combining strength and agility, ideal for activities requiring both qualities. </li>
        <li><strong>An unbalanced group (1):</strong> Exhibiting proper strength, but limited agility, suggesting a need for specific work on mobility or responsiveness. </li>
        <li><strong>A struggling group (2):</strong> With low levels in both strength and agility, indicating a need for overall improvement on these criteria. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This clustering highlights a <strong>clear discrimination between individuals</strong> according to their level of strength and agility, revealing distinct physical profiles. 
        These results could be used to <strong>customize training programs</strong>, specifically targeting the weaknesses of each group, or to <strong>orient individuals towards roles or activities tailored to their dominant skills. </strong> 
      </p><br>

      <h3>But why K-Means? </h3>
      <p>
        Here, KMeans is an ideal compromise between simplicity, speed and clarity of interpretation. The alternatives (GMM or DBSCAN) would have provided marginal flexibility, but at the cost of higher complexity and calculation time, without any significant benefit for our analyses.
        Indeed, a clustering by GMM was carried out but no notable difference between the results of KMeans and GMM was noted, except for the calculation time, slightly lower for KMeans.
      </p><br>

      <h3>Conclusion cluster</h3>
      <p>
        This clustering allows to<strong>identify typical profiles</strong> among individuals based on their physical skills (strength, agility, hand-eye coordination, and durability), thus offering an objective <strong>basis for customizing workouts, adapt strategies or optimize performance</strong> according to the strengths and weaknesses of each group.
      </p>
    </section>


    <!-- Regression -->
    <section id="regression" class="card">
      <h2>Linear regression</h2>
      <p>
        We have built a linear regression model to predict the necessary skills based on a dependent variable Y. The parameters Y and X can be freely chosen from the 10 available, but here is an example of interpretation.
      </p><br>

      <h3>Speed prediction as a function of agility (Linear regression)</h3>
      <p>
        We obtain a positive linear regression line when Agility (X) increases, the Speed variable (Y) also increases.
        As a reminder, linear regression is a method that allows to model the relationship between an independent variable, here agility, and a dependent variable, here speed, by drawing a line that predicts the value of this speed from agility.
        In our case, the positive slope of the line means that the more agile an individual is, the higher their speed is, depending on the model. This shows a proportional relationship between the 2 variables that can be used to estimate an individual’s speed from their level of agility, even for new values.
      </p>
    </section>


    <!-- Conclusion -->
    <section id="conclusion" class="card">
      <h2>Conclusion and outlook</h2>
      <p>
        The analysis of sports skills reveals a complex, multidimensional and hierarchical structure.
        Nevertheless, three basic categories of sports stand out: physical, technical and mixed sports.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this way, it was quickly realized that the most determining skills are <strong>strength</strong>,  <strong>power</strong>, <strong>agility</strong> and the
        <strong>speed</strong>, but strategy and coordination play a key role in some specific sports.
      </p>
      <p>
        Future avenues:
        <ul class="bullets">
          <li>Extend the analysis to more sports (swimming, climbing, e-sport)</li>
          <li>Use nonlinear models (Random Forest, SVM)</li>
          <li>Increase the number of parameters, such as adding training time, BMI or even the "category" of the athlete (beginner, amateur, competitor, etc) </li>
        </ul>
